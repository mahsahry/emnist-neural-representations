# EMNIST Neural Representations

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring how a neural network learns and organizes internal representations from the **EMNIST** handwritten character dataset.

The notebook includes:

- loading and preprocessing EMNIST data  
- training a neural network on handwritten characters  
- visualizing hidden-layer representations  
- analyzing class separability  
- testing robustness and generalization
