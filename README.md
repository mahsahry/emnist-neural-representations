# EMNIST Neural Representations

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring how a neural network learns and organizes internal representations from the **EMNIST** handwritten character dataset.

The notebook includes:

- loading and preprocessing EMNIST data  
- training a neural network on handwritten characters  
- visualizing hidden-layer representations  
- analyzing class separability  
- testing robustness and generalization  
---
In this project, I will be using the EMNIST dataset, specifically the digits set, to perform various experiments to better understand the behavior and performance of a deep neural network. Our main objective is to explore the internal representations developed by the model and how they change as I progress through the different layers. To accomplish this, I will perform linear read-outs at various levels of the network hierarchy to observe if the sensory representations become more disentangled in the deeper layers.
In addition to exploring the internal representations, I will also be analyzing the kinds of errors made by the model. To do so, I will create confusion matrices and psychometric curves, which can be generated by adding increasing amounts of noise to the test data. This will provide us with valuable insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
Furthermore, I will also be investigating the network's ability to handle adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are designed to deliberately mislead the model, and they are an important consideration in the development of robust and secure deep learning systems. By exploring the response of the network to these attacks, I will gain a better understanding of its robustness and what can be done to improve it.Finally, I will also be examining the network's capability of few-shot learning, which refers to its ability to generalize from only a few examples. This is a critical aspect of deep learning as it allows the network to learn new concepts with limited training data. By exploring this, I will get a better understanding of the model's ability to generalize, and what can be done to improve it.
